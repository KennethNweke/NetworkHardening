## Objective

The Network Hardening project aimed to establish a secure network topology. The primary focus was to enhance the security and resilience of a network by applying various hardening techniques by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing security controls, and follow best practices to protect network infrastructure from potential threats. 

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Network Simulation
- Packet Tracer

## Steps
- Conduct vulnerability assessments and analyze network weaknesses.
- Configure ZBPF firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and secure network devices.
- Implement ACLs
- Configured site-to-site VPN
- Layer 2 security (CDP, DHCP Snooping, ARP Inspection, Port Security and Description)
- Test and validate the effectiveness of security measures.
